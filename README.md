# Inline Code Editor Chrome Extension

A lightweight Chrome extension that transforms any `<textarea>` on a webpage into a powerful code editor using the [ACE Editor](https://ace.c9.io/). This extension adds syntax highlighting, language support, and theming capabilities directly in your browser, making it easier to write and edit code on the fly.
